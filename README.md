MML
===

MML is a Jetty service (can be turned into a webapp) which handles the 
service side of the MML-editor. While the latter deals with the user 
interface, MML is a service that converts HTML documents created by that 
interface into STILstandoff markup for storage. Also it can convert STIL 
to MML, so completing the cycle. 

The test interface of MML, at /mml/test/editor is a copy of MML-Editor, 
and supersedes it.

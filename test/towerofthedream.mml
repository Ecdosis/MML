THE TOWER OF THE DREAM.
-----------------------

PART I.
_______
    
    How wonderful are dreams! If they but be
    As some have said, the thin disjoining shades
    Of thoughts or feelings, long foregone or late,
    All interweaving, set in ghostly act
    And strange procession, fair, grotesque, or grim,
    By mimic fancy; wonderful no less
    Are they though this be true; and wondrous more
    Is she, who in the dark, and stript of sense,
    Can wield such sovereignty—the Queen of Art!
    For what a cunning painter is she then,
    Who hurriedly embodying, from the waste
    Of things memorial littering life's dim floor,
    The forms and features, manifold and quaint,
    That crowd the timeless vistas of a dream,
[20]
    Fails in no stroke, but breathes Pygmalion-like
    A soul of motion into all her work;
    And doth full oft in magic mood inspire
    Her phantom creatures with more eloquent tones
    Than ever broke upon a waking ear.

    But are they more? True glimpses oft, though vague,
    Over that far unnavigable sea
    Of mystic being, where the impatient soul
    Is sometimes wont to stray and roam at large?
    No answer comes. Yet are they wonderful
    However we may rank them in our lore,
    And worthy some fond record are these dreams
    That with so capable a wand can bring
    Back to the faded heart the rosy flush
    And sweetness of a long-fled love, or touch
    The eyes of an old enmity with tears
    Of a yet older friendship; or restore
    A world-lost mate, or reunite in joy
    The living and the dead!—can, when so wills
    Their wand's weird wielder, whatsoe'er it be,
    Lift up the fallen—fallen however low!
    Give youth unto the worn, enrich the poor;
    Build in the future higher than the hope
[21]
    Of power, when boldest, ever dared to soar;
    Annul the bars of space, the dens of time,
    Giving the rigid and cold-clanking chain
    Which force, that grey iniquity, hath clenched
    About its captive, to relent,—yea, stretch
    Forth into fairy-land, or melt like wax
    In that fierce life whose spirit lightens wide
    Round freedom, seated on her mountain throne.

    But not thus always are our dreams benign;
    Oft are they miscreations—gloomier worlds,
    Crowded tempestuously with wrongs and fears,
    More ghastly than the actual ever knew,
    And rent with racking noises, such as should
    Go thundering only through the wastes of hell.

    Yes, wonderful are dreams: and I have known
    Many most wild and strange. And once, long since,
    As in the death-like mystery of sleep
    My body lay impalled, my soul arose
    And journeyed outward in a wondrous dream.
    In the mid-hour of a dark night, methought
    I roamed the margin of a waveless lake,
    That in the knotted forehead of the land
[22]
    Deep sunken, like a huge Cyclopean eye,
    Lidless and void of speculation, stared
    Glassily up—for ever sleepless—up
    At the wide vault of heaven; and vaguely came
    Into my mind a mystic consciousness
    That over against me, on the farther shore
    Which yet I might not see, there stood a tower.

    The darkness darkened, until overhead
    Solidly black the starless heaven domed,
    And earth was one wide blot;—when, as I looked,
    A light swung blazing from the tower (as yet
    Prophesied only in my inner thought),
    And brought at once its rounded structure forth
    Massive and tall out of the mighty gloom.
    On the broad lake that streaming radiance fell,
    Through the lit fluid like a shaft of fire,
    Burning its sullen depths with one red blaze.

    Long at that wild light was I gazing held
    In speechless wonder, till I thence could feel
    A strange and thrillingly attractive power;
    My bodily weight seemed witched away, aloft
    I mounted, poised within the passive air,
[23]
    Then felt I through my veins a branching warmth,
    The herald of some yet unseen content,
    The nearness of some yet inaudible joy,
    As if some spell of golden destiny
    Lifted me onwards to the fateful tower.

    
PART II.
--------
    
    High up the tower, a circling balcony
    Emporched a brazen door. The silver roof
    Rested on shafts of jet, and ivory work
    Made a light fence against the deep abyss.
    Before that portal huge a lady stood
    In radiant loveliness, serene and bright,
    Yet as it seemed expectant; for as still
    She witched me towards her, soft she beckon'd me
    With tiny hand more splendid than a star;
    And then she smiled, not as a mortal smiles
    With visible throes, to the mere face confined,
    But with her whole bright influence all at once
    In gracious act, as the Immortals might,
    God-happy, or as smiles the morning, when
    Its subtle lips in rosy beauty part
[24]
    Under a pearly cloud, and breathe the while
    A golden prevalence of power abroad,
    That taketh all the orient heaven and earth
    Into the glory of its own delight.
    Then in a voice, keen, sweet, and silvery clear,
    And intimately tender as the first
    Fine feeling of a love-born bliss, she spoke,
    "Where hast thou stayed so long? Oh, tell me where?"

    With thrilling ears and heart I heard, but felt
    Pass from me forth a cry of sudden fear,
    As swooning through the wildness of my joy,
    Methought I drifted,—whither? All was now
    One wide cold blank; the lady and the tower,
    The gleaming lake, with all around it, one
    Wide dreary blank;—the drearier for that still
    A dizzy, clinging, ghostly consciousness
    Kept flickering from mine inmost pulse of life,
    Like a far meteor in some dismal marsh;
    How long I knew not, but the thrilling warmth
    That, like the new birth of a passionate bliss,
    Erewhile had searched me to the quick, again
    Shuddered within me, more and more, until
    Mine eyes had opened under two that made
[25]
    All else like darkness; and upon my cheek
    A breath that seemed the final spirit of health
    And floral sweetness, harbingered once more
    The silver accents of that wondrous voice,
    Which to have heard was never to forget;
    And with her tones came, warbled as it seemed,
    In mystical respondence to her voice,
    Still music, such as Eolus gives forth,
    But purer, deeper;—warbled as from some
    Unsearchable recess of soul supreme,
    Some depth of the Eternal! echoing thence
    Through the sweet meanings of its spirit speech.

    I answered not, but followed in mute love
    The beamy glances of her eyes; methought
    Close at her side I lay upon a couch
    Of purple, blazoned all with stars of gold
    Tremblingly rayed with spiculated gems;
    Thus sat we, looking forth; nor seemed it strange
    That the broad lake, with its green shelving shores,
    And all the hills and woods and winding vales,
    Were basking in the beauty of a day
    So goldenly serene, that never yet
    The perfect power of life-essential light
[26]
    Had so enrobed, since paradise was lost,
    The common world inhabited by man.

    I saw this rare surpassing beauty;—yea,
    But saw it all through her superior life,
    Orbing mine own in love; I felt her life,
    The source of holiest and truth-loving thoughts,
    Breathing abroad like odours from a flower,
    Enriched with rosy passion, and pure joy
    And earnest tenderness. Nor ever might
    The glassy lake below more quickly give
    Nimble impressions of the coming wind's
    Invisible footsteps, dimpling swift along,
    Than instant tokens of communion sweet
    With outward beauty's subtle spirit, passed
    Forth from her eyes, and thence in lambent waves
    Suffused and lightened o'er her visage bright.

    But as upon the wonder of her face
    My soul now feasted, even till it seemed
    Instinct with kindred lustre, lo! her eyes
    Suddenly saddened; then abstractedly
    Outfixing them as on some far wild thought
    That darkened up like a portentous cloud
[27]
    Over the morning of our peace, she flung
    Her silver voice into a mystic song
    Of many measures, which, as forth they went,
    Slid all into a sweet abundant flood
    Of metric melody! And to her voice
    As still she sung, invisible singers joined
    A choral burden that prolonged the strain's
    Rich concords, till the echoes of the hills
    Came forth in tidal flow, and backward then
    Subsiding like a refluent wave, died down
    In one rich harmony. It strangely seemed
    As though the song were ware that I but slept,
    And that its utterer was but a dream;
    'Tis traced upon the tablet of my soul
    In shining lines that intonate themselves—
    Not sounding to the ear but to the thought—
    Out of the vague vast of the wonderful,
    And might, when hardened into mortal speech,
    And narrowed from its wide and various sweep
    Into such flows as make our waking rhymes
    Most wildly musical, be written thus:—

[28]
THE SONG. 
---------
    
        Wide apart, wide apart,
        In old Time's dim heart
    One terrible Fiend doth his stern watch keep
        Over the mystery
            Lovely and deep,
        Locked in thy history,
            Beautiful Sleep!

        Could we disarm him,
        Could we but charm him,
    The soul of the sleeper might happily leap
    Through the dark of the dim waste so deathly and deep
        That shroudeth the triple divinity,
        The three of thy mystical Trinity:
        Gratitude, Liberty,
        Joy from all trammels free,
        Beautiful Spirit of Sleep!

        Beautiful Spirit!
        Could we confound him
            Who darkens thy throne,
        Could we surround him
            With spells like thine own;
[29]
            For the divinity
            Then of thy Trinity,
        Oh, what a blesseder reign were begun!
        For then it were evermore one,
    With all that soul, freed from the body's strait scheme,
    Inherits of seer-light and mystical dream.

        And to sleep were to die
            Into life in the Infinite,
        Holy and high,
            Spotless and bright,
        Calmly, peacefully deep;
    Ah then! that dread gulf should be crossed by a mortal,
    Ah then! to what life were thy bright arch the portal,
        Beautiful Spirit of Sleep.

    
PART III.
---------
    
    She ceased, and a deep tingling silence fell
    Instantly round,—silence complete, and yet
    Instinct as with a breathing sweetness, left
    By the rare spirit of her voice foregone;
    Even as the fragrance of a flower were felt
[30]
    Pervading the mute air through which erewhile,
    It had been borne by the delighted hand
    Of some sweet-thoughted maiden. Turning then
    Her bright face towards me, as I stood entranced,
    Yet with keen wonder stung, she said, "I love thee!
    As first love loveth—utterly! But ah!
    This love itself—this purple-wingëd love—
    This life-enriching spirit of delight
    Is but a honey-bee of paradise,
    That only in the morning glory dares
    To range abroad, only in vagrant mood,
    Adventures out into the common world
    Of man and woman, thither lured by sight
    Of some sweet human soul that blooms apart,
    Untainted by a rank soil's weedy growths;
    Lured thither thus, yet being even then
    A wilful wanderer from its birthplace pure,
    Whereto it sadly must return again,
    Or forfeit else its natal passport, ere
    The dread night cometh. Yet of how great worth
    Is love within the world! By the fair spring
    Of even the lowliest love, how many rich
    And gracious things that could not else have been,
    Grow up like flowers, and breathe a perfume forth
[31]
    That never leaves again the quickened sense
    It once hath hit, as with a fairy's wand!"
    She spoke in mournful accents wild and sweet,
    And lustrous tears brimmed over from the eyes
    That met my own now melancholy gaze.

    But not all comfortless is grief that sees
    Itself reflected in another's eyes,
    And love again grew glad: alas, not long!
    For with a short low gasp of sudden fear
    She started back, and hark! within the tower
    A sound of strenuous steps approaching fast
    Rang upwards, as it seemed, from the hard slabs
    Of a steep winding stair; and soon the huge
    And brazen portal, that behind us shut,
    Burst open with a clang of loosened bolts—
    A clang like thunder, that went rattling out
    Against the echoes of the distant hills.

    With deafened ears and looks aghast I turned
    Towards the harsh noise, there to behold, between
    The mighty jambs in the strong wall from which
    The door swung inward, a tremendous form!
[32]
    A horrid gloomy form that shapeless seemed,
    And yet, in all its monstrous bulk, to man
    A hideous likeness bare! Still more and more
    Deformed it grew, as forth it swelled, and then
    Its outlines melted in a grizzly haze,
    That hung about them, even as grey clouds
    Beskirt a coming tempest's denser mass,
    That thickens still internally, and shows
    The murkiest in the midst—yea, murkiest there,
    Where big with fate, and hid in solid gloom,
    The yet still spirit of the thunder broods,
    And menaces the world.

    Beholding that dread form, the lady of light
    Had rushed to my extended arms, and hid
    Her beamy face, fright-harrowed, in my breast!
    And thus we stood, made one in fear; while still
    That terrible vision out upon us glared
    With horny eyeballs—horrible the more
    For that no evidence of conscious will,
    No touch of passion, vitalized their fixed
    Eumenidèan, stone-cold stare, as towards
    Some surely destined task they seemed to guide
    Its shapeless bulk and awful ruthless strength.
[33]
    Then with a motion as of one dark stride
    Shadowing forward, and outstretching straight
    One vague-seen arm, from my reluctant grasp
    It tore the radiant lady, saying "This
    Is love forbidden!"; in a voice whose tones
    Were like low guttural thunders heard afar,
    Outgrowling from the clouded gorges wild
    Of steep-cragged mountains, when a sultry storm
    Is pondering in its dark pavilions there.
    Me then he seized, and threw me strongly back
    Within the brazen door; its massive beam
    Dropped with a wall-quake, and the bolts were shot
    Into their sockets with a shattering jar.

    I may not paint the horrible despair
    That froze me now; more horrible than aught
    In actual destiny, in waking life,
    Could give the self-possession of my soul.
    Within, without,—all silent, stirless, cold!
    Whither was she, my lady of delight
    Reft terribly away? Time—every drip of which
    Was as an age—kept trickling on and on,
    Brought no release, no hope; brought not a breath
    That spake of fellowship, or even of life
[34]
    Out of myself. Utterly blank I stood
    In marble-cold astonishment of heart!
    And when at length I cast despairing eyes—
    Eyes so despairing that the common gift
    Of vision stung me like a deadly curse—
    The dungeon round, pure pity of myself
    So warmed and loosened from my brain, the pent
    And icy anguish, that its load at once
    Came like an Alp-thaw streaming through my eyes;
    Till resignation, that balm-fragrant flower
    Of meek pale grief that hath its root in tears,
    Grew out of mine, and dewed my soul with peace.
    My dungeon was a half-round lofty cell,
    Massively set within the crossing wall
    That seemed to cut the tower's whole round in twain;
    A door with iron studs and brazen clamps
    Shut off the inner stairway of the tower;
    And by this door a strange and mystic thing,
    A bat-winged steed on scaly dragon claws,
    Stood mute and rigid in the darkening cell.

    The night came on; I saw the bat-winged steed
    Fade, melt and die into the gathering gloom,
    Then in the blackness hour by hour I paced,
[35]
    And heard my step—the only sound to me
    In all the wide world—throb with a dull blow
    Down through the hollow tower that seemed to yawn.
    A monstrous well beneath, with wide waste mouth
    Bridged only by the quaking strip of floor
    On which I darkling strode. Then hour on hour
    Paused as if clotting at the heart of time,
    And yet no other sound had being there;
    And still that strange, mute, mystic, bat-winged steed
    Stood waiting near me by the inner door.


PART IV.
--------
    
    At last, all suddenly, in the air aloft
    Over the tower a wild wailful song
    Woke, flying many-voiced, then sweeping off
    Far o'er the echoing hills, so passed away
    In dying murmurs through the hollow dark.
    
SONG. 
_____
    
        In vain was the charm sought
        In vain was our spell wrought
    Which that dread watcher's eyes drowsy might keep;
[36]
        In vain was the dragon-steed
        There at the hour of need
    Out with his double freight blissward to sweep.

        Lost—lost—lost—lost!
    In vain were our spells of an infinite cost!
        Lost—lost—lost—lost!
    Yon gulf by a mortal may never be crossed!
        Never, ah never!
        The doom holds for ever!
        For ever! for ever!

        Away, come away!
    For see, wide uprolling, the white front of day!
    Away to the mystic mid-regions of sleep,
        Of the beautiful Spirit of sleep.
        Lost—lost—lost—lost!

    The gulf we are crossing may never be crossed
    By a mortal, ah, never!
    The doom holds for ever!
    For ever! for ever!
    
    So passed that song (of which the drift alone
    Is here reached after in such leaden speech
[37]
    As uncharmed mortals use). And when its tones
    Out towards the mountains in the dark afar
    Had wasted, light began to pierce the gloom,
    Marbling the dusk with grey; and then the steed,
    With his strange dragon-claws and half-spread wings,
    Grew slowly back into the day again.

    The sunrise! Oh, it was a desolate pass
    Immured in that relentless keep, to feel
    How o'er the purple hills came the bright sun,
    Rejoicing in his strength; and then to know
    That he was wheeling up the heaven, and o'er
    My prison roof, tracking his midway course
    With step of fire, loud rolling through the world
    The thunder of its universal life!
    Thus seven times wore weary day and night
    Wearily on, and still I could not sleep;
    And still through this drear time the wintry tooth
    Of hunger never gnawed my corporal frame;
    No thirst inflamed me; while by the grim door
    That strange, unmoving, dragon-footed steed
    Stood as at first. Mere wonder at my doom
    Relieved the else-fixed darkness of despair!
    But on the seventh night at midnight—hark!
[38]
    What might I hear? A step?—a small light step,
    That by the stair ascending, swiftly came
    Straight to the inner door—then stopped. Alas!
    The black leaf opened not; and yet, the while,
    A rainbow radiance through its solid breadth
    Came flushing bright, in subtle wave on wave,
    As sunset glow in swift rich curves wells forth
    Through some dense cloud upon the verge of heaven:
    So came it, filling all the cell at length
    With rosy lights; and then the mystic steed
    Moved, and spread wide his glimmering bat-like wings.
    When hark ! deep down in the mysterious tower
    Another step! Yea, the same strenuous tramp
    That once before I heard, big-beating up—
    A cry, a struggle, and retreating steps!
    And that fair light had faded from the air.

    Again the hateful tramp came booming up;
    The great door opened, and the monster-fiend
    Filled all the space between the mighty jambs.
    My heart glowed hot with rage and hate at once;
    Fiercely I charged him, but his horrible glooms
    Enwrapped me closer, in yet denser coils
    Every dread moment! But my anguish now,
[39]
    My pain, and hate, and loathing, all had grown
    Into so vast a horror that methought
    I burst with irresistible strength away—
    Rushed through the door and down the stairway—down
    An endless depth—till a portcullis, hinged
    In the tower's basement, opened to my flight;
    It fell behind me, and my passage lay
    By the long ripples of the rock-edged lake.

    Then, breathless, pausing in my giddy flight,
    I saw the lustrous lady upward pass
    Through the lit air, with steadfast downward look
    Of parting recognition—full of love,
    But painless, passionless. Above the tower
    And o'er the clouds her radiance passed away,
    And melted into heaven's marble dome!
    Then fell there on my soul a sense of loss
    So bleak, so desolate, that with a wild
    Sleep-startling outcry, sudden I awoke!—
    Awoke to find it but a wondrous dream;
    Yet ever since to feel as if some pure
    And guardian soul, out of the day and night,
    Had passed for ever from the reach of love!
